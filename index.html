<h3 style="font-size:150%;">About Me</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Shiani Jain. I am currently a freshman studying Computer Science in the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My interest in Computer Science started in my sophomore year of high school, where I started learning programming on my own 
through websites such as Codecademy.com and by talking with my older brother, a computer scientist himself. Since the rest of my family is in the technology industry as well, I have grown up in a very stimulating environment that encourages discussing technology at the dinner table and pursuing 
your interests in general through hard work and dedication. I have worked on several independent projects related to computer science throughout highschool, such as building several websites and developing a calendar program as my final project in AP Computer Science my Junior year. In the future, I am planning on going
into Bioinformatics specifically in Computer Science, as this is a fusion of my interest in both Computer Science and Biology/Chemisty. Other than Computer Science,
my other interests include dance, watching TV and movies, traveling, programming, reading novels, playing the violin, painting, and sleeping. I also like to listen to pop music, and I love going to the beach. I am also a strong advocate for women in engineering! 

Please feel free to email me with any questions! Also check out my GitHub account in order to see my independent projects, as well as connect with me on LinkedIn. Thank you for taking your time to visit my website.</p>

<h4 style="font-size:150%;">Experience in Computer Science</h4>
<p>The summer after sophomore year, I interned with SAP, one of the world's largest enterprise software companies. Before starting the program, I only had some basic programming skills. I had used JavaScript to add animations, dialog boxes, and interactivity on websites. So when I started the internship and heard that SAP's software had over millions of lines of code, I could hardly believe it. How was it possible to manage so much code? I found it hard to manage more than a dozen in my own programs.
 
During the internship, I had the chance to see software developers work on different parts of the SAP software. It was interesting to see how people worked on different tasks but kept all their code working together. For example, I learned that code written by one developer had to be reviewed by others before it was implemented into the software. They did this not only to double check that the code really worked, but so that everyone could stay in sync. I used to think of programming as a solitary activity; but in the real world, teamwork and communication are equally important.

The internship really sparked my interest in programming and computer science. The rest of the summer, I learned as much about programming as I could, using textbooks and websites like Codeacdemy.com

As a result, I decided to take AP Computer Science my Junior year. For the final project, we built a computer lab reservation system. The software displayed a calendar, and users could book time slots with their names and room number. I applied what I had learned during my internship- our team spent a lot of time communicating and outlining the program before we started coding. 

I subsequently applied my skills to design and build two websites. One website was for a Business Professionals of America (BPA) competition, and the other was a personal blog about my experiences learning classical Indian dance.

In my AP Computer Science class, I was disappointed to see that there were very few female students. Being a strong advocate of women in STEM, I am glad to see that the University of Illinois supports aspiring women engineers like me.</p>

<h5 style="font-size:150%;">Dance</h5>
<p>As mentioned above, one of my main interests is dance. I am trained Indian Classical dancer in the 
dance form Kathak. I started dancing when I was five years old, on Bollywood music. I remember standing in front of the mirror, using my hands and feet, dancing, making expressions, and mimicking what I saw on Hindi television. Seeing my talent, my parents put  me into a Bollywood dance school when I six years old. Wanting more of a serious dance experience, I was subsequently enrolled in a Kathak dance school and have grown from there since. I have learned dance for over ten years, and completed my dance graduation in 2015. After graduating, I became a dance teacher in my school, and pursued dance in other capacities, such as starting my own high school dance team, working on my own choreography, and trying to learn new styles of dance. Currently, I am involved
in Illini Ishaara, an Indian classical dance team at UIUC. Dance will continue to be a big part of my life both recreationally and maybe even academically. I also have a website I made specifically describing my dance journey. You can check it out at <a href="https://www.jainshivani.com/">jainshivani.com.</a>
